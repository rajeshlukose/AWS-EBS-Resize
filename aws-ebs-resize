There’s no need to stop instance and detach EBS volume to resize it anymore
We have to  increase boot drive of Ubuntu from 10G up to 20G “on-the-fly”.
step-1) login into AWS web console -> EBS -> right mouse click on the one you wish to resize ->
“Modify Volume” -> change “Size” field and click [Modify] button
Click Yes to continue.
step-2) ssh into the instance and resize the partition:
let’s list block devices attached to our box:
lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0  20G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0   10G  0 part /
As you can see /dev/xvda1 is still 10 GiB partition on a 20 GiB device and there are no other partitions on the volume. 
Let’s use “growpart” to resize 10G partition up to 20G:
# resize partition

*growpart /dev/xvda 1

Check the Disk space after the growpart command execution
lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0  20G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0  20G  0 part /

*resize filesystem

resize2fs /dev/xvda1

There is no need to use fdisk with delete / recreate partitions
